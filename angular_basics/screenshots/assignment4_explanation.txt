For this task, I developed a new Angular component named app-yesterday that shows the weather from the previous day. I applied the @Input() decorator so that the parent component could provide data to the child component. This binding of the data was carried out with the property binding syntax within the parent's template. The value was then interpolated within the child's HTML. The component is defined as being standalone and imported properly into the main app to be displayed on the main page.
